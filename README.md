# Refactoring Steve's Stock Analysis VBA Code and Measuring Performance
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to compare a dozen stocks for Steve between the years of 2017 and 2018, and find their total daily volume (total number of shares traded throughout the day) and yearly return for each stock. We then needed to refactor the intial VBA code that was designed to analyze a dozen of stocks for Steve, and make it executable for thousands of stocks without taking a long time to execute.
## Analysis and Results

After refactoring the code we were able to shorten the run time in 2017 from 0.287 seconds to 0.066 seconds, and in 2018 from 0.273 to 0.074 seconds - it now runs for both years in about a fourth or the original run time.
