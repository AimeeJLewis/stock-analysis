# Refactoring Steve's Stock Analysis VBA Code and Measuring Performance
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to compare a dozen stocks for Steve between the years of 2017 and 2018, and find their total daily volume (total number of shares traded throughout the day) and yearly return for each stock. We then needed to refactor the intial VBA code that was designed to analyze a dozen of stocks for Steve, and make it executable for thousands of stocks without taking a long time to execute.
